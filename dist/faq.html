    <p><i>Do I need good credit to relocate to my Florida dream destination?</i></p>
    <p class="answerresponser bottompadderx">In most cases, you do need to qualify with credit check and income but the mortgage market is constantly changing, as do guidelines and programs. We can put you in contact with local lenders to see if you may qualify.</p>
    <p><i>Why does Carlisle & Hartranft use local lenders?</i></p>
    <p class="answerresponser bottompadderx">Real estate markets are very specific and no one knows their market like local lenders. We can recommend one of our experienced local lenders to speak with you in regards to getting financing for your dream home.</p>
	<p><i>Is there anything that I can do before reaching out to an associate at Carlisle & Hartranft to make the process easier or faster?</i></p>
    <p class="answerresponser bottompadderx">One of the most important things you can do is to have your financial information readily available. Be prepared to show your past 2 years tax returns, most current 60 days bank statements, most current 4 paystubs and any additional assets you may have. Having this information ready when you speak with a lender can help speed the process along.</p>
	<p><i>Can you help with finding agents in my locality to help sell my property?</i></p>
    <p class="answerresponser bottompadderx">Yes, we can help. At Carlisle & Hartranft we have established relationships with local real estate offices throughout the country and can refer you to an experienced top local agent.</p>    
	<p><i>Are there any hidden costs or obligations?</i></p>
    <p class="answerresponser">At Carlisle & Hartranft, you are under no obligation for our services. We will not hassle you. And the best part is our services are provided free of charge.</p>
